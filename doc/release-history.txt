Release History
===============

This is an overview of the changes that were incorporated into past releases.

openMSX Catapult 17.0 (2021-05-18)
----------------------------------

This release we hardly changed anything, so here is the full list:
- Do not expand environment variables in the config strings. This probably
  fixes settings with paths that contain special characters
- Build:
  - Fixed build warnings under Clang
  - Updated build warning flags
  - Removed CPU detection, as it wasn't useful for Catapult

openMSX Catapult 16.0 (2020-08-25)
----------------------------------

This release we again didn't change much, so here is the full list:
- Fix hidden openMSX window when launching from Catapult
- Migrated build to Python 3
- Migrated to wxWidgets 3.0
- Make supported extensions consistent with openMSX command line
- Replaced Accuracy control with VSync button
- Replaced Min and Max Frameskip controls with fast forward speed controls
- Added button to enable full speed when loading ("Fast Load")

openMSX Catapult 0.15.0 (2018-12-05)
------------------------------------

This release we again didn't change much, so here is the full list:
- Disable controls for joystick/printer port if the machine doesn't have them
- Fix Catapult trashing the replay at time 0 (when reversing back to time 0)
- Added .hdd extension when browsing for harddisk images
- The test machine for extensions is now C-BIOS_MSX2+ (if available)

openMSX Catapult 0.14.0 (2017-08-03)
------------------------------------

This release we again didn't change much, so here is the full list:
- Added noise control to Video Control Page
- Improved customization of build for distros
- Added support for showing build commands
- Fixed browse extension for openMSX executable
- Upgraded Visual Studio files to 2017

openMSX Catapult 0.13.0 (2016-07-31)
------------------------------------

This release we again didn't change much, so here is the full list:
- Fixed Catapult interrupting a replay directly after loading it
- Fixed drag-and-drop: put dropped file's path in input box, not in history
- Fixed memory leak noticable when reversing
- Fixed performance when reversing
- Fixed failure of handling files with quotes and with [] in their path
- Fixed plugging MIDI devices on non-Windows platforms
- Improved screenshot controls
- Upgraded Visual Studio files to 2015

openMSX Catapult 0.12.0 (2015-09-12)
------------------------------------

This release we again didn't change much, so here is the full list:
- Query machine and extension list directly from openMSX. This also eliminates
  the share dir setting, which was confusing our users, as they thought they
  could use it to configure openMSX, while it was only meant to let Catapult
  find the list of extensions and machines.
- Query ROM mapper type list from openMSX. This makes sure that Catapult will
  always offer all possible mapper types that are supported by openMSX. It also
  means not all have a full description, as that is not queried (yet) from
  openMSX.
- Fix handling of MIDI connectors: it only supported MSX-MIDI, now it is
  generic.
- Fixed some update bugs. Now Catapult should be properly updated when changing
  hardware in openMSX itself, like plugging connectors or changing machine.
- Fixed initial value of the printer port's plug: now shows --empty-- instead
  of blank.

openMSX Catapult 0.11.0 (2014-11-03)
------------------------------------

This release we didn't change much, so here is the full list:
- fixed inserting cartridges from Catapult at run time when browsing for a new
  cartridge (it did work when choosing one from history)
- added higher resolution PNG icon for non-Windows systems
- added workaround for Catapult telling that certain extensions are not
  working, although they're working fine

openMSX Catapult 0.10.1 (2014-05-01)
------------------------------------

This release we cleaned up some more code (most of the session page), and
therewith fixed even more bugs. We also added a few new features, most
importantly support for hard disks and support for changing cartridges at run
time. Be careful though, the latter will cause extensions inserted in that slot
to get removed, without Catapult showing you that!

All highlights:
- fixed disk image file not shown on UI when inserting a disk twice
- made behaviour the same for all media (was inconsistent at places)
- added support for changing cartridges at run time
- add DESTDIR support (for packagers)
- made Catapult code compatible with wxWidgets 3.0. It requires 2.8 or 3.0 now.
- fixed several bugs on the session page
- in the history of previously used media, now also store the accompanying IPS
  patches
- fixed setting the video source when there's a space in its name (e.g. Neos
  MA-20)
- removed annoying CTRL-A short cut for the About dialog
- fixed layout of About dialog
- added support for hard disk images (works of course only when such an
  extension is present)
- fixed Catapult interrupting a replay because it plugged in the cassette
  player
- fixed fps-display in the Catapult status bar
- added build support for 64-bit ARM
- added higher resolution Windows icon and logo in about box

openMSX Catapult 0.10.0 (2014-01-05)
------------------------------------

Catapult release to match openMSX 0.10.0.

This release we mostly cleaned up the code (so that other people can more
easily help improving Catapult) and fixed some (minor) bugs.

- some updates to recognize the new openMSX machine/extension directory
  structure
- fixes for several small bugs
- fixes for some memory leaks
- updated to libxml 2.8.0
- updated to wxWidgets 2.8.12
- allow setting up multiple IPS files
- added video source setting
- added disable sprites setting (for easy map creating)
- support DMK file extension in file filters
- fixed invalid PNG files (libpng 1.6 would refuse to load them)

Catapult release to match openMSX 0.7.2. No changes in Catapult.

openMSX Catapult 0.7.1 (2009-06-28)
-----------------------------------

This release comes mostly with good news for Windows users: we have a brand new
installer with binaries which have been created in a brand new way, using
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008. This means smaller binaries and also support for
64-bit Windows operating systems.

Other Windows-specific changes include:
  - Catapult is now a stand-alone binary, statically linked with wxWidgets 2.8.9
    and libxml2 2.7.3.
  - Unicode is now fully supported (no more problems with localized versions of
    Windows e.g.). Note: this means Catapult requires Windows 2000 or higher as
    of this release.

openMSX Catapult 0.7.0-R1 (2009-01-07)
--------------------------------------

This is a release to go with openMSX 0.7.0. The only change is that a bug in
the build system was fixed, nothing else has changed. The plan is still to
release a completely new Catapult as soon as possible; unfortunately we didn't
make it in time for openMSX 0.7.0.

openMSX Catapult 0.6.3-R1 (2007-12-09)
--------------------------------------

This is a release to make openMSX Catapult compatible with openMSX 0.6.3.
Like previous version, no features were added, only some compatibility issues
were fixed: added new mapper types and translated channel modes to the new
balance settings. The plan is still to release a successor for Catapult as
soon as possible; unfortunately we didn't make it in time for openMSX 0.6.3.

openMSX Catapult 0.6.2-R1 (2007-04-15)
--------------------------------------

This is a release to make openMSX Catapult compatible with openMSX 0.6.2.
No features were added, only some minor bugs were fixed. The plan is to release
a successor for Catapult as soon as possible; unfortunately we didn't make it
in time for openMSX 0.6.2.

openMSX Catapult 0.6.1-R1 (2006-07-30)
--------------------------------------

This is a release to make openMSX Catapult compatible with openMSX 0.6.1.
No features were added, only some minor bugs were fixed. The plan is to work
on a successor of Catapult as soon as possible.

openMSX Catapult 0.6.0-R2 (2006-01-29)
--------------------------------------

This is a bugfix release for Windows users.

One problem was fixed in Catapult itself: no machine was selected at the very
first startup (after scanning the available machines).

A new Windows binary release is built with a differently configured wxWidgets:
the FontMap stuff of wxWidgets gives registry problems for some Windows users,
so we disabled it.

openMSX Catapult 0.6.0-R1 (2006-01-21)
--------------------------------------

User interface:

Added: support for 2 keyjoysticks
Added: dialog to check which openMSX hardware configurations are working.
Added: menu option to display or hide broken hardware configurations.
Added: option to disable config check after setup.
Added: record button for cassette recorder, for new openMSX functionality.
Added: scaler factor selector, for new openMSX functionality.
Fixed: several details.

Compilation:

Added: Support for wxWidgets 2.6.x, which is now preferred as well.

openMSX Catapult 0.5.2-R2 (2005-06-26)
--------------------------------------

This second release of openMSX Catapult 0.5.2 is only a bug fix release.
We found that on platforms that use wxGTK, the extensions didn't work anymore.
This is due to some bug in wxGTK, but we implemented a work around for it in
this release, which should make Catapult usable again. Also, we made some
errors in the new CPU build files, which are corrected in this release.
Note: none of these changes affect Win32 users, so we will not release a new
Win32 binary.

openMSX Catapult 0.5.2-R1 (2005-06-18)
--------------------------------------

Fixed: The rensha Turbo slider wasn't updated when updated in openMSX.

Changed: There are no longer two cassette types.
Changed: History is now limited to 25 items
Changed: The input page is no longer capable of displaying formatted text.
Added: Mingw compilation support. (Although it works fine it produces a larger
       executable and it needs the mingw runtime dll).
