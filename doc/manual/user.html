<h2><a id="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a id="newver">1.1. New Versions of this Document</a></h3>

<p>
The latest version of the openMSX Catapult manual can be found on the openMSX home page:
</p>
<p>
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/catapult-manual/">http://openmsx.org/catapult-manual/</a>
</p>
<p>
The latest version of the openMSX manual can also be found there:
</p>
<p>
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/manual/">http://openmsx.org/manual/</a>
</p>
<p>
You can also use these URLs to get up-to-date versions of the hyper links
if you printed out this manual.
</p>

<h3><a id="purpose">1.2. Purpose</a></h3>
<p>
This manual is about Catapult, the (optional) GUI for openMSX. You can find
more information about openMSX on the <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/">openMSX home page</a>.
You can also download Catapult and the emulator itself from there.
</p>

<p>
openMSX is in alpha state, which means that some things work but not all
features are implemented yet. Many emulation features are implemented, but in
terms of user interface it is rather bare bones. However, since the emulation
is already pretty good, it would be nice if non-insiders would be able to play
with it, too. To allow people to use openMSX without having to find all options
the hard way, Catapult was created. Like openMSX, Catapult is still in
development and doesn't support all features we would like it to, but still it
has become a great addition to openMSX. This manual assumes that openMSX has
already been set up.
For further details how to setup and use openMSX please refer to the <a
class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/manual/">openMSX
manuals</a> .
</p>

<p>
Although Catapult was designed to be self explanatory, we still decided to
create a comprehensive manual to familiarise people with the various pages and
controls.
</p>

<p>
<em>Disclaimer:</em>
We do not claim this guide is complete or even correct.
What you do with the information in it is entirely at your own risk.
We just hope it helps you enjoy Catapult (and with that openMSX) more.

</dl>

<h2><a id="starting">2. Starting Catapult</a></h2>

<p>
On a Unix-like system, if you use a recent KDE or GNOME,
you can find Catapult in the menu, under Emulators or under Games.
If this does not work for you, you can start Catapult from the command line
by simply typing:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
    catapult
</div>

<p>
Windows users can simply double-click on the Catapult icon in the start menu if
they have chosen to create it during setup. If not, simply find the executable
and start it anyway you like.
</p>

<p>
When you start Catapult for the first time it will ask where it can find
openMSX. To
make it as easy as possible, Catapult first checks the default locations for
openMSX to see if the executable is there. If it is, you only need
to press the OK button. If it is not on the default location, you will need
to locate it yourself.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom you can uncheck the check box if you don't want to run the
hardware configuration test. We recommend to leave this on though: it will
check which MSX systems will work with openMSX and which will not. The ones
that are not working are probably missing some system ROMs. See the <a
class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/setup.html">openMSX Setup Guide</a>
on how to deal with that. By default, the list of extensions and MSX machines
that can be emulated, will only show hardware that is found to be working. You
can change that in the View menu. After having installed more ROMs, you can
always run the test again via the "File - Test MSX Hardware" menu option. </p>

<p>
After you press the OK button, Catapult's main screen appears, as shown in the picture below.
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="mainscreen.png" width="783" height="562" alt="Main Screen"></img>
</p>

<h2><a id="tour">3. A Quick Tour</a></h2>

<p>
The main screen of Catapult consists of 6 pages to separate different kinds of
functionality. This creates a much clearer interface than trying to put
everything on one page. This Section introduces the different pages and how
they can be used. It also tells about the global section of Catapult.
</p>

<p>
The next chapters discuss Catapult's functionality in detail.
You will find links in this chapter to those detailed explanations.
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_session">3.1. Session Page</a></h3>

<p>
This page lets you select which MSX machine you want to use, what extra
functionality that machine should have and what kind of media (disks,
cartridges, cassettes and hard drive images) you insert. This is the most used
page of Catapult.
[<a class="internal" href="#session">details</a>]
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_misc">3.2. Miscellaneous Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
The Miscellaneous Control Page ("Misc Controls") contains the controls that
can't easily be put in one category.
This page contains three types of controls:
</p>

<ul>
<li>controls to set the speed and frame skip of openMSX.</li>
<li>controls to push special buttons on the MSX within openMSX like power and
reset.</li>
<li>controls to plug devices into the ports of the MSX.</li>
</ul>

<p>
[<a class="internal" href="#misc">details</a>]
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_video">3.3. Video Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
This page contains all controls to select how openMSX should display the MSX
screen. Some of this controls can cause openMSX to slow down. This page also
contains some controls to let openMSX make screen shots.
[<a class="internal" href="#video">details</a>]
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_audio">3.4. Audio Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
When Catapult starts, this page looks completely empty, but once openMSX is
started, this page contains a mixer of each sound device available in the MSX.
This page also contains some controls
concerning MIDI and PCM wave input. These are only enabled when MIDI ports are
available in the currently emulated machine and/or extensions or when the
Panasonic FS-A1GT MSXturboR is being emulated, respectively.
[<a class="internal" href="#audio">details</a>]
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_input">3.5. Input Text</a></h3>
<p>
This page can be used to 'type' text in openMSX. Any text typed or copied into
the text field can be typed into the emulated MSX including newlines.
[<a class="internal" href="#input">input</a>]
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_status">3.6. Status Page</a></h3>

<p>
This page contains the messages Catapult gets from openMSX. This can be
informational messages like where the screen shot has been saved, but it can
also show warnings or errors that occur. In case of an error, Catapult
automatically selects this page.
[<a class="internal" href="#status">status</a>]
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_global">3.7. Global Section</a></h3>

<p>
The global section can be found in the bottom of the Catapult screen. It
contains the Start/Stop button to start or stop openMSX. It also contains a
representation of the LEDs of the MSX. Not all MSX machines have these LEDs, so
don't be alarmed if some LEDs don't appear to be working. At the bottom of this
section, you can find the status bar. It displays information about whether or
not openMSX is running and the number of frames openMSX displayed per second
(fps).
</p>

<h2><a id="session">4. Using the Session Page</a></h2>

<p>
Below, you can see a screen shot of the Session Page. The left side is used to
select the hardware of the MSX and the right side specifies which software
should be inserted into the MSX. Screen shots in this manual were taken in
Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 10. So, we're mixing systems here... in
general, controls might look a little different but should still be easily
recognisable.
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="session.png" width="770" height="405" alt="Session Page"></img>
</p>

<h3><a id="hardware">4.1. Selecting Hardware</a></h3>

<p>
In the top-left corner, you can select which machine openMSX should emulate.
The fact that a machine is listed, doesn't mean that it actually runs.
If a machine needs system ROM images and they are not available, that
particular machine just won't run. Catapult won't detect this lack of ROMs. You
will see the error message showing up in the Status Page. However, you can let
Catapult run a test on all found hardware configurations via the "File - Test
MSX Hardware" menu option. After testing, only working configurations will be
shown, unless you change this in the "View - Display Broken Configurations"
menu option.
</p>

<p>
More about machines and how to set them up <a class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#machines">in the openMSX manual</a>.
</p>

<p>
Below that, you can select one or more extensions. Extensions are simply MSX
cartridges (extensions to the MSX system) that you can plug into the emulated
MSX. This can be e.g. sound chips, memory mappers or drive controllers. You can
select as many extensions as you would like in Catapult, but openMSX might make
a problem. Some problems that can occur are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>too many extensions need a cartridge slot. There are a limited amount of
such slots available (most machines have only two of them). You can increase
the number of cartridge slots by also selecting the slot expander
extension.</li>
<li>two or more selected extensions are basically the same. This will cause I/O
port conflicts in the MSX machine, which you will be warned for by openMSX in
the Status Page.</li>
<li>some extensions need system ROMs; the same counts here as for the machines,
see above.</li>
<li>inserting or removing cartridges at run time may remove inserted
extensions; Catapult will not show this!</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that with Catapult it is not possible to select one extension multiple
times. We don't expect this to be a problem, however.
</p>

<p>
More about extensions <a class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#extensions">in the openMSX manual</a>.
</p>

<h3><a id="software">4.2. Selecting Software</a></h3>

<p>
The rest of this page is used for inserting media into your MSX. There are
three types of media you can use:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>disks:</dt>
<dd>
Most MSX2 or higher machines are equipped with one or more disk drives.
Moreover, openMSX supports a few external drive controllers as extensions. If a
machine doesn't have a disk drive and no such extension was added, Catapult
still lets you use these fields. openMSX, however, will in this case give an
error message.
Disks can be changed while openMSX is running (see below). See the <a
class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#disks">openMSX User's Manual</a> for more information about using disks.
</dd>
<dt>cartridges:</dt>
<dd>
Any MSX supports cartridges. These are simply put in before the MSX is started. 
openMSX also supports replacing cartridges while openMSX is running. Be
careful: this will cause existing extensions in that slot to get removed,
without Catapult showing that to you!<br/>See the <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#roms">openMSX User's
Manual</a> for more information about using ROM cartridges.
</dd>
<dt>cassettes (tapes):</dt>
<dd>
Most MSX1 computers depend on a tape recorder (or data recorder) and almost all
other MSX computers support cassette as well. Like using disks, when a machine
doesn't support cassette you can still fill in this field. openMSX will just
ignore it. In this field you can input wav-files (cassette sounds) or cas-files
(a binary representation of the cassette). Below the cassette input, there are
three more buttons. 'Rewind' simply lets you rewind the tape to the start.
'Record' will set the cassette recorder in recording mode. Currently, openMSX
only supports recording to a fresh WAV image, so you will be prompted to input
a new file name. You can also let openMSX generate a name automatically via the
menu under the 'Cassette' button. The 'Play' button switches the cassette
recorder back to play mode. This will end any recording and close the recorded
WAV file, if any. It will also rewind the current cassette, so that you can
load from it, if you like. You can of course also select another cassette
image.
<br/>
In the cassette menu, you can also disable Motor Control. Normally, an MSX uses
the 'remote control' system of a good MSX cassette recorder. This means that
the tape is only played when the MSX is actually loading something from it. By
disconnecting the 'remote' plug of such a cassette recorder, the recorder will
always play if the play button is pressed.  If 'Motor Control' is disabled,
this means that the 'remote' connector of the virtual cassette recorder is
unplugged, making the tape run even if the emulated MSX is not loading
something. See the <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#tape">openMSX User's
Manual</a> for more information about using cassettes. </dd>
<dt>hard disk images:</dt>
<dd>
If you use an extension with the current machine that implements a hard disk
drive, you can select the non-default hard disk image to be used here. If none
is selected, the default will be used instead. If no hard disk extension is
present, Catapult still lets you use these fields. openMSX, however, will in
this case give an error message. Hard disk images are only safe to be changed
while the emulated MSX is powered off. That's why Catapult will not allow you
to change hard disk images while openMSX is running. See the <a
class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#harddisks">openMSX User's
Manual</a> for more information about using harddisks.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Every media input box is equipped with a history. Just click on the down arrow to
open the history. This way you can easily select the most recently used files.
Catapult remembers the last 25 items of each media field.
</p>

<p>
The button groups on the far right are to insert or remove the various types of
media. The buttons on the left of these groups present a file selection window,
in which you can select which media file should be used. The buttons on the
right are to eject media. No conformation is asked for this.
</p>

<p>
The buttons left of the media field can be used to show a pop-up menu with
some extra options. Options shown in these pop-ups are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Browse for disk/ROM/cassette/harddisk image</dt>
<dd>These options are the same as when you use the browse buttons on the right
of the media fields</dd>
<dt>Browse for disk folder (disks only)</dt>
<dd>
Instead of selecting a specific disk file, you can also select a complete
directory.
This option is in openMSX known as DirAsDisk. Please check the <a
class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#dirasdisk">openMSX User's
Manual</a> for the limits using this feature.
</dd>
<dt>Eject disk/cartridge/cassette/harddisk</dt>
<dd>These options are the same as when you use the eject buttons on the right
of the media fields</dd>
<dt>Select IPS Patches (disks and cartridges)</dt>
<dd>
Instead of inserting a trained or translated disk or ROM image, you can also
select one or more patches which will be applied after loading the image.
Choosing this option results in a special dialog in which you can add or remove
patches and change the order of the patches. The patches are always applied in
the order shown. If openMSX is running, disk patches are immediately applied
when selected. This menu item will show the number of patches selected.
</dd>
<dt>Selected cartridge type (cartridges only)</dt>
<dd>
If a cartridge is not available in the ROM databases and openMSX can't detect
the type properly, you can use this option to force a cartridge type. Please
contact us if you find ROM images that are incorrectly detected. See <a
class="internal" href="#contact">9. Contact Info</a> for this. This menu item
always shows a short representation of the type selected.
</dd>
<dt>Rewind cassette (cassette only)</dt>
<dd>Choosing this option is the same as pressing the 'Rewind' button</dd>
<dt>Motor Control (cassette only)</dt>
<dd>See above for an explanation of this.</dd>
<dt>Auto create Cassette file for recording (cassette only)</dt>
<dd>See above for an explanation of this.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a id="updating">4.3. Updating Media</a></h3>

<p>
Catapult uses two different kinds of updating schemes. When openMSX is not
running and you change some of the media input boxes, nothing really happens
until you actually start openMSX. At that moment, the used values are added to
the history and the history is saved. Of course, these values are then used in
openMSX.
If openMSX is already running and you change a disk or tape, this will be
updated according to the following criteria:
</p>

<ul>
<li>when you select a disk, cartridge or tape using history or the browse
facility, openMSX updates immediately.</li>
<li>when you type in the filename of a disk, cartridge or tape, openMSX updates
as soon as the cursor leaves the media input box.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In both cases, the history is updated.
</p>

<p>
Again, do note that updating cartridges while extensions are inserted, will
mean that the extension in that slot will be removed and Catapult will not show
this in the user interface!
</p>

<h2><a id="control">5. Using the Control Pages</a></h2>

<p>
This section explains what you can do to control many aspects of openMSX.
Catapult is using the so-called CliComm interface. This interface allows you to
send messages to openMSX to change a number of settings and parameters.
openMSX, in its turn, can also send messages to Catapult telling if any setting
or parameter has been changed and if requested commands have been processed
without problems.
</p>

<h3><a id="misc">5.1. Miscellaneous Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
Below you see a picture of the Miscellaneous Control Page while openMSX is
running. If openMSX is not running, most controls will be disabled. (You can
still set up what's in the joystick ports.)
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="misc.png" width="543" height="328" alt="Miscellaneous Controls Page"></img>
</p>

<p>
The top section of this page consists of a number of controls with which you
can influence the speed and frame skip setting of openMSX. The upper row
controls the <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/commands.html#speed">speed
percentage</a> of openMSX. You can use the slider to select a speed between 1
and 500%. You can also directly input the speed into the input box. Finally,
the buttons on the right are to set the speed to respectively 100% and the
maximum. If the Max Speed Button is used, all limits are removed. Very useful
to fast forward demos or loading screens. If the selected speed is higher than
your PC can manage, openMSX will try to go as fast as possible. The next rows
selects how many frames may be <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/commands.html#maxframeskip">maximally
skipped</a> to maintain the chosen speed and how many frames are <a
class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/commands.html#minframeskip">minimally
skipped</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the centre of this page, you can find the so-called action controls. These
control the behaviour of the MSX directly. The power control can turn the MSX
on or off. When Catapult starts openMSX, the power is always on. The Reset
button <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/commands.html#reset">resets</a> the
MSX. The Pause button pauses the emulation completely. Finally, the <a
class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/commands.html#firmwareswitch">firmware
button</a> lets you choose whether or not you want to enable the firmware in
the MSX you are emulating (if available).
</p>

<p>
The bottom of the page allows you to hook devices to the MSX connectors.
</p>
<p>
For each <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#joystick">joystick
port</a>, you can choose between a <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#mouse">mouse</a>,
keyjoysticks, the <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#arkanoidpad">Arkanoid
pad</a>, a <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#trackball">track
ball</a>, a <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#touchpad">touch pad</a>,
some dongles and any joysticks hooked up to the PC. If you select the same
device for both ports, you get a warning and a request for confirmation. This
allows you to choose which port the selected device should be in. These are the
only controls that can be modified before openMSX is started. You can also
adjust the <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/commands.html#renshaturbo">Ren Sha
Turbo speed</a> (joystick auto fire) if the current MSX supports it (MSXturboR,
for instance). </p>
<p>
You can hook a Printer logger or SIMPL in the printer port. When you choose the
Printer logger, you can also choose which file to use for the log by either
typing it directly or browsing for it. If you plug SIMPL (a very simple Digital
to Analog Converter) into the printer port, openMSX supports it as an extra
audio device. You can also see a slider for it appearing it the Audio Controls
page.
</p>

<h3><a id="video">5.2. Video Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
Below you see a picture of the Video Control Page while openMSX is running.
If openMSX is not running, most controls will be disabled.
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="video.png" width="734" height="360" alt="Video Control Page"></img>
</p>

<p>
In the top-left corner, you can select which renderer is used by openMSX.
</p>

<p>
With the top-centre controls you can select which scaler should be used. You
can select both the scaling factor and the scaling algorithm. Scalers determine
how the picture is scaled to higher resolutions than 320&times;240 (if you use
a factor greater than 1). Beware that some scalers can be really slow. The
algorithms are sometimes quite complex.
</p>

<p>
The Accuracy control lets you select the accuracy level openMSX uses to draw
the screen.
</p>

<p>
See for an explanation of renderers, scalers and accuracy the
<a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#renderers">openMSX
User's Manual</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Video Source control selects which video source is visible on the openMSX
window. Usually it's just "MSX", but in some cases you might want to show the
GFX9000 for instance (or Video9000, which has some features to superimpose the
MSX image over the GFX9000 image). More info in the <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#gfx9000">openMSX User's
Manual</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Deinterlace button toggles the deinterlacing effect on or off. When a real
MSX is in interlace mode, you can see the screen flashing. When deinterlace is
off you get that same effect on openMSX. If this toggle is switched on, the
picture holds perfectly still.
</p>

<p>
The Limit sprites button allows you to let openMSX draw as many sprites on a
horizontal line as necessary. With the sprite limit switched off, some games
will stop flashing their sprites. This feature is on by default since that's
closest to a real MSX. Some programs rely on the sprite flicker effect and may
thus look bad if you turn this off.
</p>

<p>
The Full screen button switches openMSX to full screen mode. The first time you
do this, there will be a warning how to get back. You can disable this warning
if you want to. Windows users can also get back to windowed mode by switching
back to Catapult (using ALT-TAB) and simply deselecting full screen again.
</p>

<p>
The Disable sprites button allows you to disable sprites in order to create
screenshots of games without sprites, useful for making maps.
</p>

<p>
The centre part of this page allows you to modify the openMSX screen. All of
these settings can be controlled by using the slider, typing the value directly
into the edit field or using the reset button to revert to the default state.
These settings are pretty much self-explanatory, or otherwise explained in the
<a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#videoeffects">openMSX
User's Manual</a>. Glow is only supported in the SDLGL-PP renderer.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line of the page can be used to create screen shots from openMSX. As
soon as a filename is available in the first box, the second box will show a
counter. This counter is
based on the number of files that already exist. So if <code>test</code> is
typed and <code>test0001</code>, <code>test0002</code> and
<code>test0003</code> exists, then the counter will show <code>0004</code>. The
browse button can also be used to set a filename, however the counter part will
recalculated. So even if you browse and try to open <code>test0002</code> the
result will still be <code>test0004</code>. You can also override the counter
by just typing another number, but as soon as you change the name again, the
counter will be recalculated. Normally, there is no reason to override the
counter.
</p>
<p>
Finally, pressing the Grab button takes the screen shot. If the filename and
counter fields are empty, openMSX will take a screen shot with the default
settings. The first time, there will be a message that the shot has been taken
and that the location is shown in the Status Page, since no further changes
are noticeable. You can disable this message when it pops up. So, again, the
location of the screen shot taken will be shown in the Status Page.
</p>

<h3><a id="audio">5.3. Audio Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
Below you see a picture of the audio control page while openMSX is running. If
openMSX is not running, the controls will be disabled and instead of the mixer
a simple message will be displayed stating: "No audio channel data available".
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="audio.png" width="543" height="333" alt="Audio Controls Page"></img>
</p>

<p>
The top half of this page is used to adjust the volume and channel mode of the
sound devices present in openMSX. When a slider is all the way up, volume is set
to maximum and if it's all the way down that specific device is muted. The mode
selector below each slider lets you choose between L(eft), R(ight), M(ono) and
(O)ff. However, some sound devices only support S(tereo) (and Off, of course).
</p>

<p>
The bottom part of this page can be used to select where the sound I/O devices
are redirected to. The top of this section lets you choose what is plugged into the
MIDI-IN port. You can at least choose between <code>--empty--</code> and
<code>midi-in-reader</code>. Windows users also have the choice to use one of
the native MIDI devices. The field besides the selector is only used when
<code>midi-in-reader</code> is selected. In this case, this allows you to select
from which file the MIDI input is taken.
</p>

<p>
The second row of controls is to select what is plugged into the MIDI-OUT port.
Possibilities are <code>--empty--</code> and <code>midi-out-logger</code>.
Windows users can, again, also select native MIDI devices. The field right of
it allows you to select in which file the MIDI output is stored in case
<code>midi-out-logger</code> is chosen. In UNIX systems you might want to
choose <code>/dev/midi</code> to route the MIDI data to a MIDI device you have
connected to your system.
</p>

<p>
MIDI-IN and MIDI-OUT are only available when you're emulating a machine or
extension with MIDI ports. If there are multiple MIDI ports available, only one
can be controlled with Catapult.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the last row is to select the PCM wave input, which is only
available on the MSXturboR GT. You can choose <code>--empty--</code>
or <code>wavinput</code>. In case of <code>wavinput</code>, the field besides
it selects from which file the PCM input is taken.
</p>

<h2><a id="input">6. Input Text</a></h2>
<p>
Below, there's a picture of the Input Text page.
</p>
<p class="image">
<img src="input.png" width="545" height="334" alt="Audio Controls Page"></img>
</p>
<p>
This page contains only three controls. The big text field can be used to type
or paste any text you want typed out in the emulated MSX. All characters typed
in this field will be typed in the MSX, so it could take a while when there's a
large text.
Any newlines within this field will result in an <code>enter</code> in the MSX.
The text is transmitted to the MSX as soon as the type button is used. The text
will not be automatically cleared, so the same text can be used multiple times.
Finally, the clear button clears the text, so you can start over. A final note:
this feature may not work entirely correctly for Japanese and not at all for
Korean characters.
</p>

<h2><a id="status">7. Status Display</a></h2>

<p>
The status display of Catapult consists of four different elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Status Page</li>
<li>Global Section with:
 <ul>
  <li>LED Status Display</li>
  <li>Emulator Status</li>
  <li>Frame rate display</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Status Page displays all messages given by openMSX. This includes
informational messages, but also warnings and errors and output from the debug
device (see the
<a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/manual/user.html#debugdevice">openMSX
User's Manual</a> for more information) if it is configured to output to
<code>stderr</code>. Informational texts are displayed in black, warnings are
displayed in dark red while errors can be recognised by their bright red
colour. This display is cleared whenever openMSX is started.
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="status.png" width="579" height="376" alt="Status Page"></img>
</p>

<p>
The LED status display in the Global Section shows the status of the MSX LEDs
at any given time. Which LEDs are used depends on the type of MSX computer
openMSX is emulating.
</p>

<p>
The final part of the Global Section is the status bar, at the bottom of the
Catapult window.
</p>

<p>
On the left side of the status bar you can see whether or not the emulator is
running. This can be convenient if you have multiple Catapults in use. It will
also tell you if openMSX is paused.
</p>

<p>
Finally, on the right side of the status bar, you'll find the frame rate
display, which shows you how many frames openMSX is displaying per
second. When the emulator runs at 100% speed, this should be 50 or 60 fps
(depending on the current display frequency of the MSX). When you increase the
speed of openMSX, the fps count should also be increased. Bear in mind that
when using SDLGL-PP (OpenGL), your video driver may force the fps to your
monitor refresh rate to avoid disturbance while drawing. Also, if this display
shows a frame rate below 50 fps, your computer is actually a bit to slow to
generate all frames in time with the current settings and thus frames are being
skipped.
</p>

<h2><a id="menu">8. Using the menu</a></h2>
<p>
Although most of the Catapult action is done using the various pages mentioned
above, there are a few options only available through the pull down menu. These
options are described briefly in this section.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
Test MSX Hardware
</dt>
<dd>
This will start the hardware configuration test. Use it to check which openMSX
hardware configurations are actually working. See also <a href="#starting">2.
Starting Catapult</a> and <a href="#hardware">4.1. Selecting Hardware</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
Quit
</dt>
<dd>
This closes Catapult. If there is a running openMSX (started by this instance
of Catapult) it will be closed also.
</dd>
<dt>
Edit Configuration
</dt>
<dd>
Here you can change which openMSX version Catapult is to start, if you
installed more than one. See also <a href="#starting">2. Starting Catapult</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
Load openMSX Settings
</dt>
<dd>
Here you can browse for an openMSX settings file to be used. This settings file
will be used the next time you start openMSX. This option is not saved when you
close Catapult.
</dd>
<dt>
Save openMSX Settings
</dt>	
<dd>
This option is only available when openMSX is running. You can ask openMSX to
save its settings to the default location (which is
<code>share/settings.xml</code>).
</dd>
<dt>
Save openMSX Settings As
</dt>
<dd>
This option is only available when openMSX is running. You can ask openMSX to
save its settings to a specified file.
</dd>
<dt>
Save openMSX Settings On Exit
</dt>
<dd>
When is option is on (indicated by a check mark in front of it), openMSX will
save its settings as soon as it closes. Keep in mind that Full Speed and Mute
settings e.g., will also be saved!
</dd>
<dt>
Display Broken Configurations
</dt>
<dd>
Check this if you want Catapult to display openMSX hardware configurations
(machines and extensions) which were found to be not working when the Test MSX
Hardware feature was last used. By default it is unchecked, which means the
broken configurations are hidden, so that you cannot accidentally select one.
</dd>
<dt>
About
</dt>
<dd>
Shows information about Catapult including the version number.
