Release Notes for openMSX Catapult for openMSX 17.0 (2021-03-31)
================================================================

Catapult release to match openMSX 17.0.

This release we hardly changed anything, so here is the full list:
- Do not expand environment variables in the config strings. This probably
  fixes settings with paths that contain special characters
- Build:
  - Fixed build warnings under Clang
  - Updated build warning flags
  - Removed CPU detection, as it wasn't useful for Catapult

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly. Use the spacebar to
  deselect extensions! CTRL-click also works.
- not feature complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert
  to the openMSX console (press F10/Cmd+L) or the OSD menu (MENU key/Cmd+O)
